# ü§ñ AI-Powered Article Generator

## Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Article Generator** is a web application that transforms various forms of interview-style content into clean, concise, and engaging articles.  
Users can upload a **PDF**, paste a **website URL**, or provide a **YouTube video link**.  
The backend automatically processes the content and uses a **large language model (LLM)** to generate a ~300-word article, complete with an automated title and subtitle.

This project is an excellent example of a **full-stack AI application**, demonstrating:
- **Serverless architecture**
- **Multi-source data processing**
- **Seamless integration with an external LLM API**

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Multi-Source Input**: Process content from PDFs, website URLs, and YouTube video links.  
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Converts unstructured interview content into a coherent, well-written article.  
- **Smart Options**: Customize the output by providing specific instructions for tone, length, and language.  
- **Auto Title & Subtitle**: The LLM automatically generates a relevant title and subtitle for each article.  
- **Efficient Backend**: Serverless functions handle content extraction and API calls, ensuring scalability.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, or a simple HTML file for a clean and responsive UI.  
- **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js).  
- **PDF Extraction**: [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) for client-side text extraction.  
- **LLM Integration**: Hugging Face Inference API for text generation.  
- **Automation**: n8n workflow to orchestrate requests and responses.

## üîÑ n8n Workflow Setup

### 1. Create a Webhook Node

* Add a **Webhook node** and set **HTTP Method** to `POST`.
* Click **Listen for Test Event** and copy the unique URL.
* This is the endpoint your frontend will send data to.

### 2. Add an HTTP Request Node

* Connect an **HTTP Request node** to the Webhook.
* This node will send the prompt to the **Hugging Face API**.

**Settings:**

* Authentication ‚Üí **Header Auth**
* Header Name ‚Üí `Authorization`
* Header Value ‚Üí `Bearer YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN`
* Request Method ‚Üí `POST`

The final output must be in the following exact format, without any extra text or conversation:\n\nTitle: <Article Title Here>\n\nArticle: <Article Content Here>\n\nText to Analyze:\n{{ $json['text'] }}"
}
```

### 3. Add a Respond to Webhook Node

**Body:**

```json
{
  "title": "{{ $json.generated_text.match(/Title:\\s*([^\\n\\r]+)/i)[1] }}",
  "article": "{{ $json.generated_text.match(/Article:\\s*([\\s\\S]+)/i)[1] }}"
